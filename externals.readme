The externals.txt points to the initial externals for the project.

The project is to be used for development of modules against the
release of Hyrax 1.6.1, so we point at the tags of the bes, libdap and
olfs.  

All modules are pointed to the trunk versions since this is new development. 

If a module's changes require changes to libdap, bes, or olfs, THIS
PROJECT MAY NO LONGER BE USED and the developer needs to switch to the
main trunk/shrew version with trunk versions of all parts.
